Bandstructure of Gallium Nitride along the $\hat{z}$ direction ($\Gamma\rightarrow A$), continued onto imaginary values of the wavevector (within the $k\cdot p$ approximation, neglecting spin-orbit coupling, using parameters from \cite{Rinke_2008}).  In imaginary $k$-space, the conduction band and light-hole band meet, allowing a particle to "tunnel" continuously between the real bands.

\section{Summary and Directions}
We have discussed two formalisms for determining the transmission coefficients appropriate for direct interband tunneling transitions, and how they might be extended.  For the final presentation, I will push both methods in the directions listed toward applicability in the Gallium Nitride spiked $pn$ junction system and compare with experimental data.

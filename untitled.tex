\begin{abstract}
Analytical formalisms to model interband tunneling, including the Kane method and the WKB approach, are discussed in general.  Directions are suggested for how to apply these formalisms to a tunneling device of recent interest, the spiked $pn$ junction in GaN, which lacks the simple band structure and uniform fields assumed by conventional models.

\section{Kane's model}
Whereas Sze's approach could be described as a time-independent WKB method within the effective mass picture of transport, Kane instead applies time-dependent perturbation theory to the the Wannier equation
$$i\hbar\partial_t\psi_n(r,t)=E_n^0(k)\psi_n(r,t)-e\phi(x)\psi_n(r,t)+\sum_{n\neq n'} W_{n\,n'}\psi_{n'}(r,t)$$
where the effect of the electric field $-\partial_x\phi(x)$ is two-fold.  First, by removing translation symmetry, it mixes the $k$-states within a band, and, secondly, it provides matrix elements $W_{n\neq n'}$ that mix bands together.  Kane solves for the wavefunctions with $W$ set to zero, and then applies Fermi's golden rule to determine the transition rate between bands.

In Kane's approach, the Wannier equation is expressed not as above, but rather in the crystal momentum basis.  The procedure is the same in principle, though expression in this basis provides an integral which Kane was able to approximate analytically via the method of steepest descent.  Nonetheless, use of the crystal momentum basis becomes burdensome for all but the most trivial field profiles (the position operator is represented by a derivative in $k$-space, so fields that are non-trivial functions of position become higher-order derivatives in the Wannier equation).  Recent generalizations of Kane's model to non-uniform fields thus prefer the familiar position representation \cite{Tanaka_1993}.
